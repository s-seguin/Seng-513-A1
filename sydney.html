            <h2>Sydney Harbour Bridge</h2>
            <p>A unique view from the pedestrian walkway.</p>

            <p>In September 2018 my brother and I travelled to Cairns Australia to start our four month trip taking us across Australia and New Zealand. One of the highlights of the thrip was Sydney, which was filled with many must see world famous sites. Think, the Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, etc. We loved just walking around the city and exploring as there was so much to see. Central Sydney was filled with many different buildings especially of older architectural styles, as well as China Town. Then there was world famous Bondi Beach, stunning but extremely busy and the Northern Beaches, Manly and Dee Why which were equally stunning but a bit less busy. </p>
            <p>During our walking around Sydney we decided to cross the world famous Sydney Harbour Bridge. On the bridge we got great views of the Sydney Opera House, however I felt this image was to cliche. One of the things that fascinated me most with Sydney was their double decker trains. I really like this photo I captured because it shows the double decker train entering the frame from the left approacing the traffic with the pedestrian fence and the bridge framing the cars and train with the skyline in the background.</p>
