                <p>In September 2018 my brother and I travelled to Cairns Australia to start our four month trip taking
                    us across Australia and New Zealand. One of the highlights of the thrip was Sydney, which was
                    filled with many must see world famous sites. Think, the Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, etc.
                    We loved just walking around the city and exploring as there was so much to see. Central Sydney was
                    filled with many different buildings especially of older architectural styles, as well as China
                    Town. Then there was world famous Bondi Beach, stunning but extremely busy and the Northern
                    Beaches, Manly and Dee Why which were equally stunning but a bit less busy. </p>
                <p>During our walking around Sydney we decided to cross the world famous Sydney Harbour Bridge. On the
                    bridge we got great views of the Sydney Opera House, however I felt this image was to cliche. One
                    of the things that fascinated me most with Sydney was their double decker trains. I really like
                    this photo I captured because it shows the double decker train entering the frame from the left
                    approacing the traffic with the pedestrian fence and the bridge framing the cars and train with the
                    skyline in the background.</p>
