                    <p>Early spring 2018 my friend Colin and I decided we wanted to go backpacking. We had missed most of
                        the season the previous year unfortunately, and Colin was leaving for Europe in July and myself to
                        Australia and NZ in September so we would have very little time to go camping this year. We thought
                        the trail would be most clear of snow and ice, unfortunately that was not the case. The trail had
                        so much snow on it we couldn't follow it. Instead we followed the lake shore as much as we could as
                        we made our way to Point campground in Kanaskis. The hike normally takes about 1 hour in the
                        summer, but it took us closer to 3 this time. When we got to the campground, all the first sites
                        were burried in snow with water from the melt pooling on what was open of the pad. Luckily we were
                        able to find a dry site.</p>
                    <p>We cooked Mac and Cheese for dinner, but because of the snow there wasn't a lot to do. And the KD
                        wasn't as filling as we were hoping for. Our goal was to stay up till after dark to try some
                        astro-photography. This particular photo was taken by leaving a headlamp on in the tent, and using
                        about a 15sec exposure. It still doesn't quite do the stars justice. However I was very happy with
                        how the photo came out, the contrast between the tent, the tree and the night sky makes for quite
                        an interesting photograph. Overall it was a great night, watching the shooting stars and seeing the
                        Milky Way.</p>
