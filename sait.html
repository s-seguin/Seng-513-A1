                <p>In spring of 2017 I took a photography class at Sait Polytechnique during the evenings to try and
                    learn some theory and get some more practice with my camera, to improve my photography. The lessons
                    were pretty basic, however the hands on experience as well as the tips and tricks from the
                    instructor really helped me improve my photos and opened my eyes and mind to new ways of doing
                    things. So overall it was quite a good experience and I would recommend taking photography courses
                    with them.</p>
                <p>This photo was taken after one of our classes on colour, and using your cameras white balance
                    settings to help modify the colour of the image to make a more pleasing photograph. This especially
                    aplies to using the camre to make the image a little bit warmer, as this is often view favourably.
                    In SAIT there is a section of building that has LED lights that continously change colour. I
                    particularly liked the Zig Zag patterns of the escalators here and thing that mixed with the lights
                    makes for quite a cool image.</p>
