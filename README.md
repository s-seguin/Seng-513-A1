# Seng-513-A1

The main objectives of this assignment are:
 
 -to design a simple website by manually crafting HTML and CSS, and
 
 -to publish the website.


It is up to you to pick a topic of your website. Here are some suggestions:

  -cooking recipes;
  
  -sport fan;
  
  -car fan;
  
  -tutorial or manual;
  
  -event (wedding, reunion, party,etc).

Requirements:
The website must consist of at least 4 different pages, including a top-level page.
All pages must share the same external style sheet.
It must be possible to navigate between the pages:
it should not be possible to get stuck on any page;
ideally you will provide direct access to any page using some content navigation table/list on every page;
at minimum every page will include a link to the top page.
Every page must include at least one picture.
Your site must use (at least once) the following HTML elements:
table, nicely styled with CSS; and
list (ordered or unordered).
The whole site must look pretty (font, layout, color theme). Once you select a topic for a website, you can get inspiration by looking for that topic on the web.
Your assignment must be publicly viewable. That means you must host it on a publicly available web server. We discussed some free hosting choices in the class.
All files (html & css) must be written by hand (manually). You cannot use an application to auto-generate your html or css, e.g. you cannot use MS Word to export html/css.
The html/css must be nicely formatted, so that a human can easily read it.
Make sure your site works as intended in at least the following desktop browsers: Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
Submission details for this assignment:
Submit a PDF document with the following information:

  -your name, student ID and tutorial section;
  
  -URL of your website;
  
  -which browsers you tested with your website.
  
  -Upload the PDF to D2L dropbox.

General information about all assignments:
All assignments are due on the date listed on the assignment.  Late assignments or components of assignments will not be accepted for marking without approval for an extension beforehand. What you have submitted in D2L as of the due date is what will be marked.

Extensions may be granted for reasonable cases, but only by the course instructor, and only with the receipt of the appropriate documentation (e.g., a doctor's note). Typical examples of reasonable cases for an extension include: illness or a death in the family. Cases where extensions will not be granted include situations that are typical of student life, such as having multiple due dates, work commitments, etc. Forgetting to hand in your assignment on time is not a valid reason for getting an extension.

After you submit your work to D2L, make sure that you check the content of your submission. It's your responsibility to do this, so make sure that your submit your assignment with enough time before it is due so that you can double-check your upload, and possibly re-upload the assignment.

All assignments should include contact information, including full name, student ID and tutorial section, at the very top of each file submitted.

Assignments must reflect individual work.  Group work is not allowed for assignments, nor can you copy the work of others. For further information on plagiarism, cheating and other academic misconduct, check the information at this link: http://www.ucalgary.ca/pubs/calendar/current/k-5.html.

You can and should submit many times before the due date. D2L will simply overwrite previous submissions with newer ones. Itâ€™s better to submit incomplete work for a chance of getting partial marks, than not to submit anything.

Only one file can be submitted per assignment. If you need to submit multiple files, you can put them into a single container. The container types supported will be ZIP and TAR. No other formats will be accepted.

Assignments will be marked by your TAs. If you have questions about assignment marking, contact your TA first. If you still have question after you have talked to your TA then you can contact your instructor.
