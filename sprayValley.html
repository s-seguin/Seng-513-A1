                <p>In the summer of 2018, my friends Colin, Justin and I decided to go hiking everyweekend. Our goal
                    was to see as much of Kanaskis and Spray Valley as we could. One hike that we really loved was
                    Sparrowhawk, its about 8km long with 1400 meters of elevation gain. So it is very strenous and
                    difficult but the views are more than worth it. Hiking this much over the summer truly allowed us
                    to appreciate how fortunate we are to live in such a beautiful area of the world. We are surrounded
                    by such beatutiful and pituresque views. </p>
                <p>This particular phot was take on one of the shoulders of the hike. The hike essentially starts with
                    a very steep climb up a mountain than curves in towards the moutain where you hike up past a small
                    peak and then continue on up througha scree slope to the summit. There are incredible views to be
                    had throughout the hike. However I particulairly loved the views and photos from the shoulder as
                    they allowed you to still see the road clearly. I think the dust from the gravel road in this photo
                    really helps draw the eye into the frame and the beatutiful mountains in the background.</p>
